Small Backup
============

This application is for making periodical backups. I made it mostly to learn things and practice, back in 2006. It includes some cool features:

* C++ (Visual Studio);
* Excluded CRT to reduce .exe file size, custom classes for strings etc;
* Pure WinAPI for everything, including whole interface;
* Custom schedule format (seems I didn't know cron format back then or though it's not flexible enough);
* Simple web-site, many source-code comments, some documentation;
* I tried to make it as small and as fast as possible.
